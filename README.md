# Air-Sense-Real-time-IoT-based-air-quality-monitoring-system

This project implements a low-cost IoT-based air quality monitoring system using an ESP8266 microcontroller integrated with MQ135 gas and DHT11 temperature/humidity sensors. It continuously measures air pollution levels and transmits real-time data to the Blynk cloud platform for easy monitoring via mobile or web apps. Users receive instant alerts when pollution exceeds safe limits, enabling timely action to protect health. The system is simple, scalable, and ideal for homes, classrooms, and community environments.
